# Chinese & Japanese characters (Hanzi & Kanji) list
This is a compilation of different lists for the Chinese and Japanese languages.

I could not find a comprehensive compilation of all the different Chinese characters used in different countries, languages and periods. Therefore I compiled my own from different sources.
Some of which may officially be recognized by countries or institutes.

exemplary usages:
* for fonts: determine the amount of character glyphs a given font covers
* analyzing your vocabulary
